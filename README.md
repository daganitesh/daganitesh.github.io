# My Resume ✨

This is my resume, created using HTML and CSS. You can view it live [here](https://nitesh-daga.github.io/).

## About ℹ️

Creating a resume that fits everything within a single page can be a challenge, especially when using resume templates. With the flexibility of HTML and CSS, I have designed my resume to overcome these limitations and present my information in a visually appealing and concise manner.

## Why HTML and CSS? 🌟

By utilizing HTML and CSS, I have complete control over the layout, formatting, and styling of my resume. This approach allows me to customize the content to highlight my skills, experience, and achievements effectively.
